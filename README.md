AI Sentiment Analysis:
The code uses a CoreML model (SentimentClassifier) to classify text sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.
Bitcoin SV Transaction:
You define a Bitcoin SV transaction in the recordSentimentOnBSV() function.
The transaction includes the sentiment data as an OP_RETURN output, meaning it is stored on-chain but not spendable.
Signing and Broadcasting:
The transaction is signed using a private key and then broadcasted to the Bitcoin SV network. You can use libraries like bsv.js for the actual signing and broadcasting part.
Future Enhancements:
sCrypt Smart Contract: You can define a simple smart contract using sCrypt, which could validate the sentiment data before logging it on-chain.
API Integration: Use real-time APIs to fetch the current price of BSV or interact with other blockchain elements.
